# 2.0

This release of Mantle contains major breaking changes that we were unable to
make after freezing the 1.0 API.

The changes in 2.0 focus on simplifying concepts and increasing flexibility in
the framework.

For a complete list of the changes made in Mantle 2.0, see [the
milestone](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle/issues?q=milestone%3A2.0+is%3Aclosed).
